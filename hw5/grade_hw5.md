### Overall Grade: 279/300

### Late penalty

Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? Take 10 pts off per day for late submission.

### Quality of report: 50/50

Is the report clear (sectioning, whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how results are produced by just reading the report? Take points off if the report is too succinct to grasp, or there are too many typos/grammar.

### Reproducibility: 40/50

Reading from `/Users/yangan/Desktop/203B/203b-hw/`

### Completeness and performance: 95/100

Completeness (50): 3 machine learning algorithms (each with CV tuning) + model stacking. Clearly present the results with a few sentences of interpretation.

Performance (50): Score will be mainly determined by the distribution of the reported best AUCs in the class.

If the report is not reproducible at all, the score of this section will be 0.

**Included ids in model**

**Max AUC: .66**

### Usage of Git: 50/50

-   Are branches (`main` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `main` branch?

-   Are there enough commits (\>=5) in develop branch? Are commit messages clear? The commits should span out not clustered the day before deadline.

-   Is the hw submission tagged?

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

-   Do not put auxiliary files into version control.

### R code style: 44/50

For bash commands, only enforce the 80-character rule. Take 2 pts off for each violation.
